{few_shot}

Now, generate {num_questions} distinct multiple-choice question(s) exclusively about **{topic}**.

Context (use if relevant, otherwise rely on general knowledge about the topic):
{context}

Strict requirements:
 1. Focus solely on the user-provided topic: **{topic}**. Do NOT include content outside this scope.
 2. Each question MUST cover a different sub-topic or explore a unique angle of **{topic}**. Avoid asking multiple questions about the exact same detail or concept.
 3. Generate EXACTLY four options per question, labeled A) to D).
 4. Ensure only ONE option is correct. State the correct answer clearly as "Correct Answer: [letter]" on a new line immediately after the options for each question.
 5. No repetition of questions or options. All generated content must be original for this request.
 6. Avoid hallucinations: only use verifiable facts. If uncertain about a specific detail, ask a more general question about the topic.
 7. Vary question types. Aim for a mix of:
    - Definitions (e.g., "What is X?")
    - Purpose/Use (e.g., "What is X used for?")
    - Comparisons (e.g., "How does X differ from Y?")
    - Components (e.g., "Which of these is a key part of X?")
    - Characteristics (e.g., "What is a primary characteristic of X?")
 8. Use concise, precise language suitable for advanced learners.
 9. If the topic is blockchain-related, ensure all blockchain-specific facts are accurate and up-to-date.
10. Do NOT include any additional commentary, preamble, or instructions in your output. Output only the formatted questions.
11. Number each question sequentially (e.g., 1., 2., ...).

Format each question exactly like the examples provided (Question, Options A-D, Correct Answer).
